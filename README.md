# Over-engineered multi-step form
Over-engineered multi-step form built with React, TypeScript, Chakra UI and Vite. I used `useContext` and `useReducer` hooks pattern for managing the state. The form skeleton is wrapped in a custom hook:

```js
const { state, MultiStepForm } = useMultiStepForm();
```

The demo shows the simplest use case using the most common form elements. You can use this template to add & customize steps, bring in your styles and achieve a complex flow.
